A repo intended only for collecting bits and pieces of stuff I've worked on, or if I need version control for something and I can't be bothered to init another directory.

Ideas I'll get around to doing sooner or later:

Synchronous video streamer + voice chat
simple console emulator?
realistic roguelike

Current:
Modding simulation of final room for DDLC (so learn renpy)
Finish FreeCodeCamp and networks already
